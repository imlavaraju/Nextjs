## Next.js 14 Version

### What is Next.js?

Next.js is a popular open-source framework built on top of React for building modern web applications. It extends React with features like server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, and simplified routing, providing several benefits:

1. **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Renders React components on the server before sending them to the client, enhancing performance and SEO.

2. **Automatic Code Splitting**: Splits code into smaller bundles, improving initial page load times by loading only necessary code.

3. **Routing**: Uses a file-based routing system where each page is a React component stored in the `pages` directory, simplifying page creation and management.

4. **CSS-in-JS**: Built-in support for CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-jsx and CSS Modules for styling components.

5. **API Routes**: Allows creation of API endpoints with serverless functions, enabling easy backend functionality alongside frontend code.

6. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Supports generating HTML pages at build time, offering faster performance for static content.

7. **TypeScript Support**: Built-in support for TypeScript, enabling type-safe coding if preferred over JavaScript.

### How to Install Next.js?

To install Next.js, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

### Routing in Next.js

In Next.js, routing is built-in and uses a file-based approach. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. Create a new folder in the `pages` directory of your Next.js app.
2. Inside this folder, create a new file `page.js` or `page.jsx`.
3. Now, `mywebsite.com/new_folder` will serve as your endpoint for routing.
